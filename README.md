# Flower Shop Database
> I used Microsoft **SQL Server Management Studio 18** for this project.
## Goal
I myself don't know clearly yet.  
A Flower Shop database, Which customers can purchase from the shop or online.
### CreatTable.sql:
This file contains queries for creating the required tables of this flower shop.
The order of creating is important because of foreign keys.
### Insert.sql :
 This file contains queris for inserting test data to tables. Be patient while inserting data. ;)    
 Note that I used **IDENTITY** for primary keys of the many tables and deleting some data you may have problems with adding the same data to the database because of FKs.
 ### Queries_Phase2.sql:
 This file contains queris for creating views and function that may be needed in the shop.  
 It also contains some useful and repetitive queries.
 ### diagram_flowershop.pdf:
 The diagram of the Flower Shop database which is created by SQL Server Management Studio.  
 It helps with analyzing the database rapidly.
